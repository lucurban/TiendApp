<h2>🏷️ Overview</h2>
<p>
TiendaApp is an application developed in <strong>Python</strong> for managing inventory and sales in a store.
</p>
<p>
Its objective is to facilitate the control of products, prices, and sales transactions by automating tasks that are normally performed manually.
</p>
<p>
The program allows you to check inventory, update stock levels and prices, record sales, and generate sales summaries for user-specified dates, 
all while working directly on an Excel file.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to this, the information remains organized and easily accessible, without the need for a complex database.
</p>
<p>
This project began as a practical exercise to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and data handling with Pandas and Openpyxl, demonstrating 
how a simple solution can become a useful and flexible tool for any small business or local shop.
