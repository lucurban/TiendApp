<h1 align="center">TiendApp</h1>

<h2>🏷️ Overview</h2>
<p>
  TiendaApp is an application developed in <strong>Python</strong> for managing inventory and sales in a store.
</p>
<p>
  Its objective is to facilitate the control of products, prices, and sales transactions by automating tasks that are normally performed manually.
</p>
<p>
  The program allows you to check inventory, update stock levels and prices, record sales, and generate sales summaries for user-specified dates, 
  all while working directly on an Excel file.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to this, the information remains organized and easily accessible, without the need for a complex database.
</p>
<p>
  This project began as a practical exercise to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and data handling with Pandas and Openpyxl, demonstrating 
  how a simple solution can become a useful and flexible tool for any small business or local shop.
</p>

<h2>⚙️ Main features</h2>
<p>
  TiendaApp is designed so that anyone can manage the basics of their store without needing advanced technical knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  Its structure is based on simple but well-organized tasks, reflecting what happens day-to-day in a real business.
</p>
<p>
  Its main features include:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🧾 <strong>Inventory Management:</strong> allows you to review available products, their quantities, and units of measure (grams or units).</li>
    <li>✏️ <strong>Stock Update:</strong> easily adjusts quantities when new products arrive or inventory discrepancies are detected.</li>
    <li>💰 <strong>Price Control:</strong> keeps purchase and sale prices updated, automatically calculating the profit margin for each product.</li>
    <li>🛍️ <strong>Sales Log:</strong> saves daily sales, generating a history with date, product, quantity, price, and subtotal.</li>
    <li>📊 <strong>Sales Summary:</strong> generates reports showing sales made and the daily total on the date requested by the user.</li>
    <li>📁 <strong>Integration with Excel:</strong> uses .xlsx files to store all the information, leveraging the Pandas and Openpyxl libraries.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Together, these features allow TiendaApp to act as a small digital store assistant: organized, reliable, and always ready to record a new sale.
